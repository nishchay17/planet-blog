# Understanding useCallback vs. useMemo in React

React offers two important hooks, useCallback and useMemo, that play a crucial role in optimizing the performance of your components. While both hooks deal with memoization, they serve different purposes and are used in distinct scenarios.

In this blog post, we will explore the differences between useCallback and useMemo and understand when to use each.

## useMemo: Memorizing Values

> useMemo is used to memoize the result of expensive computations. It prevents recalculating values on every render, returning the memoized result unless dependencies change.

This is the simple one to use in both of these, as this is just a cache for result of a function call.
This is as simple dymanic programming/caching.

### Example:

```jsx
import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(10);

  // Without useMemo, this calculation would be performed on every render
  const squaredValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating squared value");
    return value * value;
  }, [value]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Original Value: {value}</p>
      <p>Squared Value: {squaredValue}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, squaredValue is memoized using useMemo. The calculation is
only performed when value changes, preventing unnecessary recalculations.

> In the real world, this example is not a great contender for using useMemo but we can look for functions that might take
> too long to compute and just use useMemo to cache the result.

## useCallback: Memorizing Functions

> useCallback is a React hook designed to memoize functions, preventing unnecessary re-creation of functions during re-renders.

In my personal experience, this hook is a bit tricky and might not be useful every time if you think you need to use
useCallback take a step back and think can you refactor the code in such a way that you might not even need a useCallback.
I will guide you through an example to drive my point across.

If you look at [react documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback#usage) there are four use cases for use call back.

1. Skipping re-rendering of components
2. Updating state from a memoized callback
3. Preventing an Effect from firing too often
4. Optimizing a custom Hook

Which is mainly saying to use useCallback to make memo work properly.
If updating the state based on the previous state use the updater function and not add the state in the dependency array of useCallback,
how to prevent infinite render if some function is in the dependency array of a useEffect.
Wrap any custom hook into useCallback.

I highly recommend reading the [react documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback#usage) for things to do,
but let's cover things that **we should not do while using useCallback**.

## Preventing re-rendering

Here I have used _memo_ and _useCallback_ for preventing re-render then we increase the counter.
This is a ok way of doing this, but we can also do this without the use of these 2 hooks.

```jsx
import { memo, useCallback, useState } from "react";

function Page() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: "Item 1" },
    { id: 2, name: "Item 2" },
    { id: 3, name: "Item 3" },
  ]);
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const handleClick = useCallback((itemId) => {
    console.log(`Item ${itemId} clicked`);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>List of Items</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter((c) => c + 1)}>{counter}</button>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <ChildComponentMemo key={item.id} item={item} onClick={handleClick} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ item, onClick }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{item.name}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => onClick(item.id)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
const ChildComponentMemo = memo(ChildComponent);
export default Page;
```

Now let's see how and why we can remove _memo_ and _useCallback_ and still not have the _ChildComponent_ render
when _counter_ changes.

```jsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

function Page() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: "Item 1" },
    { id: 2, name: "Item 2" },
    { id: 3, name: "Item 3" },
  ]);

  const handleClick = (itemId: any) => {
    console.log(`Item ${itemId} clicked`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>List of Items</h1>
      <CounterComponent />
      {items.map((item) => (
        <ChildComponent key={item.id} item={item} onClick={handleClick} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function CounterComponent() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCounter((c) => c + 1)}>{counter}</button>;
}

function ChildComponent({ item, onClick }: { item: any; onClick: any }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{item.name}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => onClick(item.id)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Page;
```

Here I have separated the counter state into its own component, making the count state component and the ChildComponent sibling component,
previously when the counter state was changing it was causing rendering of the child component,
but now these two are sibling component and therefore the re-rendering will not be triggered while changing counter state.

## Event firing to many times

Here in this, when we are using some function inside of _useEffect_ we also pass that into the
dependency array, but as the re-render recreates the function the useEffect is called again which might be setting some state which causes re-rendering again, making it an infinite cycle.
For fixing that we normally use _useCallback_ like this

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";

function Page() {
  const [flag, setFlag] = useState(false);

  const fetchFlag = useCallback(() => {
    return fetch("/api/flag").then((res) => res.json());
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchFlag().then((data) => setFlag(data.flag));
  }, [fetchFlag]);

  return <p>Foo bar {flag}</p>;
}

export default Page;
```

But if there is no use of the function (_fetchFlag_ in this example) then we can
easily remove use of _useCallback_ by moving the function inside of _useEffect_

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Page() {
  const [flag, setFlag] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      setFlag((await fetch("/api/flag").then((res) => res.json())).flag);
    })();
  }, []);

  return <p>Foo bar {flag}</p>;
}

export default Page;
```

> the reason why I am not making the _useEffect_ callback as _async_ and then fetching
> is because it is a bad practice to mark the _useEffect_ callback as _async_

In conclusion, useCallback and useMemo are powerful tools in React that can significantly enhance the performance of your components.
By memoizing functions and values strategically, you can avoid unnecessary re-renders and optimize the computational efficiency of your application.
Remember, while these hooks are valuable, it's essential to use them judiciously and with a clear understanding of their impact on your codebase.

Thanks for exploring these React hooks with me, and happy coding!

# Background

I wanted to share different cool things I know, read, or watch on YouTube, and for that, I needed a place to share it, dev.to or medium.com came into my mind but I needed something more personal and this is an excuse for another personal project!

## Things I needed in the blog site

> aka requirements

- Solid SEO
- Small bundle size
- Server-side rendered (for the most part anyways)
- Easy to add content
- Analytics

## The tech-stack

I ended up using Next js (frontend framework), tailwind (CSS library), content layer (content manager), and Highstorm (Analytics) for various reasons so lets discuss them

# Design

So let's go through all the things I picked and why

## Next js

First it's the default framework that I am using now, but most importantly it gives me SSR and that I really wanted, as I want the site to be quick and the content is static anyways (advantage of not using some CMS).

## Tailwind

Again the default CSS framework for me, but with Shadcn UI this becomes even more powerful, as I don't need to build basic components from the ground up.

## Content layer

Now for this, I needed a solution that is not hosted somewhere else like a CDN, in a nutshell I needed something completely offline and with no additional request over the wire.

## Highstorm

Simple, open-source, free, and have integration with Slack. (not very powerful but)

## Project Structure

The project stucture is a pretty common Next 14 project structure
